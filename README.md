# DSND-blog-post-project

The goal for this project is to study the following questions for the US medical equipment data:

Questions:

    What are the most important features of the data set, what do they mean, and how do they drive the predicted outcome? 
    What unusual, or creative, insights are you able to gather from the data set?
    How accurate is the model that you have trained to predict the data in the data set?
    What will happen in a creative, predictive, scenario using the model that you have trained?
